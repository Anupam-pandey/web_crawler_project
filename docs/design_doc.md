}
```

### Storage Technologies

1. **Primary Metadata Store**
   - Amazon DynamoDB or Google Firestore
   - Schema: URL as partition key, domain as sort key
   - Global secondary indexes for efficient domain-based queries
   - Time-to-Live (TTL) for automatic pruning of old entries

2. **Raw Content Storage**
   - Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage
   - Partitioned by domain and date
   - Lifecycle policies to transition:
     - 0-30 days: Standard storage
     - 30-90 days: Infrequent access
     - 90+ days: Glacier/Archive storage

3. **Analytics Data**
   - Amazon Redshift or Google BigQuery
   - Denormalized for analytical queries
   - Partitioned by time for efficient historical analysis

4. **URL Queue**
   - Amazon SQS or Google Cloud Pub/Sub
   - Multiple queues for different priorities
   - Dead letter queues for failed crawl attempts

## Scaling Strategy

### Horizontal Scaling

1. **Crawler Instances**
   - Auto-scaling groups based on queue depth
   - Regional deployment for geographic distribution
   - Instance types optimized for network I/O

2. **Processing Pipeline**
   - Serverless functions for metadata extraction
   - Container-based workers for content analysis
   - Event-driven architecture

### Vertical Scaling

1. **Database Read/Write Capacity**
   - On-demand scaling for DynamoDB
   - Provisioned throughput for predictable workloads

2. **Storage Capacity**
   - Automatic scaling of storage resources
   - Tiered storage for cost optimization

### Distributed Processing

1. **Map-Reduce Jobs**
   - Batch processing for large-scale analysis
   - Distributed across compute clusters

2. **Stream Processing**
   - Real-time analysis of newly crawled content
   - Kafka or Kinesis for data streaming

## Politeness and Robots.txt Compliance

### Domain-Specific Policies

- Distributed cache of robots.txt rules
- Domain-specific crawl delays (default: 1 request per second)
- Exponential backoff for server errors
- Custom politeness rules for high-traffic sites

### Implementation

- Domain-based sharding of crawler instances
- Token bucket rate limiting per domain
- Centralized configuration service for policy updates
- Monitoring for compliance violations

## Optimizations

### Cost Optimization

1. **Compute Resources**
   - Spot instances for batch processing
   - Reserved instances for baseline capacity
   - Serverless for variable loads

2. **Storage Optimization**
   - Compression for raw HTML (gzip/brotli)
   - Incremental storage of changes
   - Content deduplication

3. **Network Optimization**
   - Regional crawlers to minimize egress costs
   - Batch operations to reduce API calls
   - Connection pooling

### Performance Optimization

1. **Caching Layers**
   - Redis cache for frequently accessed metadata
   - DNS cache to reduce lookup times
   - Robots.txt cache with appropriate TTL

2. **Concurrent Crawling**
   - Asynchronous I/O for network operations
   - Connection pooling per domain
   - Prioritized scheduling based on importance

3. **Batch Processing**
   - Bulk inserts for database operations
   - Batch analysis of related content
   - Parallel processing of independent tasks

## Reliability Engineering

### Fault Tolerance

1. **Graceful Degradation**
   - Circuit breakers for external dependencies
   - Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
   - Dead letter queues for failed jobs

2. **Data Redundancy**
   - Multi-region replication for critical data
   - Backup and restore procedures
   - Point-in-time recovery

### Monitoring and Alerting

1. **System Metrics**
   - Crawl rate (URLs/second)
   - Success/failure ratios
   - Processing latency
   - Queue depth

2. **Business Metrics**
   - Coverage (% of target URLs crawled)
   - Freshness (average age of data)
   - Completeness (% of metadata fields populated)

3. **Alerts**
   - Elevated error rates
   - SLA violations
   - Unusual patterns (potential denial of service)

## SLOs and SLAs

### Service Level Objectives

   - Medium-priority URLs: < 7 days
   - Low-priority URLs: < 30 days

### Key Monitoring Metrics

1. **Crawler Performance**
   - URLs crawled per second
   - Average crawl time per URL
   - Success/failure rate
   - Robots.txt compliance rate

2. **System Health**

   - Content parsing success rate

4. **Cost Efficiency**
   - Cost per million URLs crawled

## Security Considerations

1. **Data Protection**
   - Encryption at rest and in transit
   - Access control policies
   - PII detection and handling

2. **Crawler Identity**
   - Clear user agent identification
   - Verification endpoints for site owners
   - Contact information for opt-out requests

3. **Compliance**
   - GDPR and CCPA considerations
   - Respect for copyright and terms of service
   - Legal review of crawling policies
